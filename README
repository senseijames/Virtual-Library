                                    Milestones
I. Console Output Prototype
Purpose - get the structure and workflow going before sexying up the view with the 3D engine
1. Simple console view output - output one file's information
2. Simple user interface - add a file browser (text field and button), so the user can select a file and input the directory for search
3. Mapper algorithm - get FileSystemMapper searching a directory recursively, and return proper data structure
   Key - determining the proper data structure.
4. Final console view output - get console displaying 'bookcases'.  Determine a good I/F for the view, as the 3D engine will use the same I/F
5. Advanced user interface - add a search box (text field) so the user can filter the results by simple filename match (contents search is beyond the scope of this project)
* 6. Menu - adjust program settings and select virtual folders to view
Output - the structure of the program will be complete

II. 3D Engine Prototype
Purpose - replace the console view with a sexy 3D Virtual Library.
Also - touch up the user interface (file browser and live search)
1. Create the room
2. Room navigation - add controls for navigating the room (disable when control is in the Chrome's search field)
2. Very simple output - circles on a rectangle with text; a circle and text for each file (book), and a large rectangle for the bookcase
3. Replace circles with file icons
4. Create bookcase models, replace rectangles with bookcases
5. Click each file to select it, double click to open it (open menu instead?  No, just a prototype!)
6. Live search effects
7. Adding files to a virtual folder
8. Viewing virtual folders
